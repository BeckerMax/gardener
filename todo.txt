TODO:

- test case for CRI.containerruntimes
- additional testcases:
  - We want: cri.nil should be allowed on an image with any cri configuration (we require that when we remove docker support all shoots select a CRI explicitly (through defaulting or manual).
  - Images supporting multiple containerruntimes
